The code used for my Discrete Structures final project at Northeastern University (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EKq-hbD0mU).

I used Manim (see https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.1.1/) for this as I was inspired by 3Blue1Brown's animations.

Because I didn't have too much time to work on this, the code is a little sloppy and the organization is certainly lacking.
